## Learning Plan 2024 IBMer watsonx Challenge Education for IBM Consulting


There are some courses that I highly suggest to take before start the Challenge.


[![](assets/2024-07-06-10-32-38.png)](https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-392A3DE753AC)


## Prompt Engineering with IBM Consulting Assistants

The course covers everything from the basics of accessing IBM Consulting Assistants to advanced features and creative ways to use them. IBM Consulting practitioners will learn about IBM Consulting Advantage Strategy, how foundation models and large language models work, basics of prompt engineering and how it mitigates LLM’s limitations. It also helps practitioners learn managing teams and customizing the interface for clients.

### IBM Consulting Assistants Sales Enablement

This course enables IBM consultants and sales executives to effectively use the IBM Consulting Assistants and integrate Assistants into their deals. You will learn how to use the platform to transform business operations, augment your daily tasks, and drive productivity across various roles within IBM. The course covers key features of the platform including interaction with large language models, document analysis, and integrating external data sources.

More information [here](https://github.ibm.com/ruslan-idelfonso-magana-cic/IBM-Learning-Paths-WatsonX/blob/master/Section2/README.md)
### IBM's AI assistants - IBM watsonx Orchestrate, watsonx Assistant, and watsonx Code Assistant

This course covers IBM's set of AI assistant solutions, which leverage generative AI to empower individuals to achieve higher performance and success. You will learn how to convey to clients the business value of IBM's AI assistants - IBM watsonx Orchestrate, watsonx Assistant, and watsonx Code Assistant. 

More information [here](https://github.ibm.com/ruslan-idelfonso-magana-cic/IBM-Learning-Paths-WatsonX/blob/master/Section3/README.md)


### Generative AI and watsonx for IBM Consulting

Generative AI and watsonx for IBM Consulting

This course will help build your foundational knowledge of Generative AI and watsonx. It's the first step of a longer learning path that will unfold over the next several months. Our understanding of Generative AI varies widely across IBM Consulting. It’s incredibly important that we master this content—and it’s also incredibly important that we spend time helping our clients do the same.

More information [here](https://github.ibm.com/ruslan-idelfonso-magana-cic/IBM-Learning-Paths-WatsonX/blob/master/Section4/README.md)


### Generative AI and watsonx Experienced Course

This section include the core required learning from IBM Consulting's Experienced Level Generative AI curriculum.  This course must be completed within any of the plans in that Experienced-level curriculum.  Completing it here will grant you credit within the role-based learning plan of your choice and get you started toward achievement of the Experience-level badges.

These Experienced badges are designed for IBM Consulting roles to help you deliver generative AI solutions with watsonx, your choice of Strategic Partner technologies, or both. Each plan is tailored to the specific needs of a role, building up from the core generative AI education to the specialized training, watsonx, and Strategic Partner technologies required to perform that role.

More information [here](https://github.ibm.com/ruslan-idelfonso-magana-cic/IBM-Learning-Paths-WatsonX/blob/master/Section5/README.md)
