### Generative AI and watsonx Experienced Course

This section include the core required learning from IBM Consulting's Experienced Level Generative AI curriculum.  This course must be completed within any of the plans in that Experienced-level curriculum.  Completing it here will grant you credit within the role-based learning plan of your choice and get you started toward achievement of the Experience-level badges.

These Experienced badges are designed for IBM Consulting roles to help you deliver generative AI solutions with watsonx, your choice of Strategic Partner technologies, or both. Each plan is tailored to the specific needs of a role, building up from the core generative AI education to the specialized training, watsonx, and Strategic Partner technologies required to perform that role.
