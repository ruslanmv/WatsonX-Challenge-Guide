**Large Language Models (LLMs) and Their Limitations**
=====================================================

**What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?**
-----------------------------------------

Large Language Models (LLMs) are mathematical functions that take input and generate output based on statistical patterns learned from vast amounts of training data. They can be thought of as probabilistic, statistical algorithms that compress training data into a model. The model parameters, system prompt, and input (or context) influence the output generated by the LLM.

**How do LLMs Work?**
---------------------

LLMs work by taking input (e.g., a question or action) and generating an output based on the model parameters, system prompt, and context. The model parameters control the output, such as the temperature (randomness or creativity) and maximum token limit (upper ceiling of response length). The system prompt guides the conversation, ensuring respectful and safe responses. The context, or conversational memory, influences the output based on previous interactions.

**Limitations of LLMs**
---------------------

Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are not yet capable of true understanding or reasoning. They are limited to generating responses based on statistical patterns in the training data. This can lead to hallucinations (inaccurate or irrelevant responses) when the model lacks sufficient context or is not thoroughly prompted.

**Practicing with IBM Consulting Assistants**
--------------------------------------------

To better understand how LLMs work, let's practice using IBM Consulting Assistants. We'll experiment with different model parameters, removing prompts or responses under 'Context Settings', and asking job-related questions.

**Objective**
------------

Our objective is to learn how IBM Consulting Assistants respond to job-related prompts and help with tasks.

**Practicum**
------------

Enter each prompt in the chat window and observe the responses:

1. Help me write an email.
2. Create a project plan on induction training.
3. Write an email on request for a meeting.

**Outcome**
----------

After completing this task, you should understand:

* IBM Consulting Assistants can respond to job-related prompts and help with tasks.
* You can experiment with different model parameters and context settings to refine the output.

**Understanding Model Parameters, System Prompt, and Context**
---------------------------------------------------------

To generate accurate and relevant responses, it's essential to understand the advanced settings in IBM Consulting Assistants.

**Model Parameters**
-------------------

* **Temperature**: Controls the randomness or creativity of the response.
* **Max New Tokens**: Defines the maximum upper limit of the response length (in tokens, approximately 3/4 of a word).
* **Min New Tokens**: Controls the minimum amount of generated text for every answer.

**System Prompt**
-----------------

Guides the conversation, ensuring respectful and safe responses.

**Context**
----------

The conversational memory, which influences the output based on previous interactions. You can delete or modify context settings to refine the output.

**Available Models, Model Cards, and Selecting the Right Model**
---------------------------------------------------------

IBM Consulting Assistants provides various LLMs. To select the right model for the right task, visit [Choosing a foundation model in watsonx.ai](https://watsonx.ai/) and [Supported foundation models available with watsonx.ai](https://watsonx.ai/).

**Basics of Prompt Engineering**
=====================================

**Mitigating LLMs' Limitations Through Prompt Engineering**
--------------------------------------------------------

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but they also have limitations, such as biases, ethical concerns, and lack of common sense. Prompt engineering techniques can help mitigate these limitations by guiding the models to generate more appropriate and accurate responses.

**Understanding Prompting Techniques**
------------------------------------

Prompting techniques are methods used to guide LLMs toward generating more accurate and relevant responses. There are three popular prompting techniques:

### Zero-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting involves providing a prompt that is not part of the training data to the model, but the model can generate a result that you want. This promising technique makes large language models useful for many tasks.

### One-Shot Prompting

One-shot prompting takes the concept of zero-shot a step further. Instead of asking the model to perform a task where it has not been trained at all, you provide a single example of the task you want it to perform. The model then uses this single example to generate text.

### Few-Shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting is a technique in which few examples are provided that a model can use to inform its answer. For example, a few-shots technique can be used in a classification task.

**Practicing Different Types of Prompting in IBM Consulting Assistants**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have understood what are zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques, let's try practicing them.

**Objective**

**Outcome**

Now, after completing this task, you have learned:

* How IBM Consulting Assistants responds to zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompts.
* You can try more such prompts in IBM Consulting Assistants.

**Chain of Thought Prompting**
------------------------------

Chain of thought prompting is a technique that involves guiding an LLM to generate a sequence of responses that are connected to each other in a logical and coherent way. This prompting technique allows complex reasoning through intermediate steps and can be combined with few-shot prompting for better results.

**Practicing Chain of Thought Prompting in IBM Consulting Assistants**
