**WatsonX Challenge: Track 1 - AskIBM**
=====================================================


**Introduction**

Welcome to the WatsonX Challenge for Track 1 - AskIBM! In this challenge, you'll have the opportunity to create a custom productivity workflow to enhance the IBMer AskIBM experience. As an IBMer, you'll work with a team of up to 10 people to build a workflow that uses generative AI to improve productivity, automate tasks, and solve business problems in your role. The best part? No coding skills are required!

**Understanding the Challenge**

The AskIBM platform offers two main capabilities: content creation and summarization. Your task is to build a custom workflow that leverages these capabilities to improve your productivity and workflow. Some possible use cases for custom-built workflows include:

* Summarizing meeting transcripts
* Drafting emails to clients
* Creating a subject matter expert on a focused knowledge base

**Getting Started**

Before you begin, make sure you've completed the AI Assistants Level 1 learning course by July 19 to be eligible for prizes. This course will provide you with the necessary foundation to build your workflow.

**Step-by-Step Guide to Building Your Workflow**

1. **Define Your Problem Statement**: Identify a specific business problem or task that you'd like to automate or improve using AskIBM. This will help you focus your workflow and ensure it's relevant to your role.
2. **Determine Your Workflow Requirements**: Break down your problem statement into specific tasks and requirements. What inputs will you need? What outputs do you expect? What are the key steps involved in completing the task?
3. **Write Instructions (Prompts) for Your Workflow**: Using natural language, write clear and concise instructions for your workflow. This will guide the workflow's output and ensure it meets your requirements.
4. **Provide Specific Examples and/or Upload Relevant Documents**: To help the workflow understand your requirements, provide specific examples or upload relevant documents that demonstrate the desired output.
5. **Test and Refine Your Workflow**: Once you've built your workflow, test it with different inputs and scenarios. Refine your workflow as needed to ensure it's producing the desired outputs.
6. **Submit Your Workflow**: Once you're satisfied with your workflow, submit it to the WatsonX Challenge platform.

**Important Reminders**

* **Data Privacy and Security**: Make sure to follow the data privacy and security guidelines outlined in the Terms and Conditions Section 13.
