**WatsonX Challenge: Track 1 - AskIBM**
=====================================================

**Introduction**

Welcome to the WatsonX Challenge for Track 1 - AskIBM! In this challenge, you'll have the opportunity to create a custom productivity workflow to enhance the IBMer AskIBM experience. As an IBMer, you'll work with a team of up to 10 people to build a workflow that uses generative AI to improve productivity, automate tasks, and solve business problems in your role. The best part? No coding skills are required!

**Understanding the Challenge**

The AskIBM platform offers two main capabilities: content creation and summarization. Your task is to build a custom workflow that leverages these capabilities to improve your productivity and workflow. Some possible use cases for custom-built workflows include:

- Summarizing meeting transcripts
- Drafting emails to clients
- Creating a subject matter expert on a focused knowledge base

**Getting Started**

Before you begin, make sure you've completed the AI Assistants Level 1 learning course by July 19 to be eligible for prizes. This course will provide you with the necessary foundation to build your workflow.

**Track Details**

- **Open for**: all IBMers (non-technical)
- **Tool**: AskIBM
- **Team size**: up to 10 people
- **Support**: #track_1_askibm

**The Challenge**

### What is your goal?
AskIBM launched a new feature that allows IBMers to create custom workflows for their specific needs. For this challenge, you will create a "workflow" in AskIBM tailored to your team's needs using the instructions and guidelines below. You will be asked to provide a report outlining an overview of the business case you are addressing with the workflow, the steps you carried out to create the workflow, as well as expected outcomes measured in time saved. All of this will be documented within an AskIBM challenge report template. Your team will then submit the report along with a URL for your workflow.

### How does a workflow help me?

**Define your project**: Take the opportunity of the challenge to apply AI to your day-to-day work. Define the specific task (use case) your new AskIBM workflow will address. The clearer and more specific you are, the better the AI can assist you.

Select one from the following options to complete during the challenge:

**Option 1 – Create your own use case**

Consider your daily tasks and where AskIBM could save you time or improve the quality of your work. Think about repetitive tasks that can be automated or new ways that AI can assist you. You can use AskIBM to create a customized workflow that would boost your productivity.

**Option 2 – Tailored writing assistance**

Use AskIBM to create a custom workflow to draft the text for frequent emails, Slack direct messages, or generate reports tailored to your needs. By creating a workflow, you can format it for specific channels, audience tone, and style of communication.

**Option 3 – Tailored summaries**

Use AskIBM to create summaries tailored to a specific topic or domain, formatted according to your preferred style, such as bullet points, paragraphs, detailed, or high-level.

### Questions to get you started

- What repetitive tasks can be automated?
- How can AI improve the quality of my work?
- What specific outputs do I need from AskIBM?

**Step-by-Step Guide to Building Your Workflow**

1. **Define Your Problem Statement**: Identify a specific business problem or task that you'd like to automate or improve using AskIBM. This will help you focus your workflow and ensure it's relevant to your role.

2. **Determine Your Workflow Requirements**: Break down your problem statement into specific tasks and requirements. What inputs will you need? What outputs do you expect? What are the key steps involved in completing the task?

3. **Write Instructions (Prompts) for Your Workflow**: Using natural language, write clear and concise instructions for your workflow. This will guide the workflow's output and ensure it meets your requirements.

4. **Provide Specific Examples and/or Upload Relevant Documents**: To help the workflow understand your requirements, provide specific examples or upload relevant documents that demonstrate the desired output.

5. **Test and Refine Your Workflow**: Once you've built your workflow, test it with different inputs and scenarios. Refine your workflow as needed to ensure it's producing the desired outputs.

6. **Submit Your Workflow**: Once you're satisfied with your workflow, submit it to the WatsonX Challenge platform.

### Technical Limitations and Best Practices

- **Select measurable use cases**: Choose use cases where current performance can be quantified. This allows for a clear comparison to the productivity benefits of your workflow.
- **Remember the token limit**: AskIBM handles around 8,000 tokens (about 6,000 words) for both input and output combined. Exceeding this limit may reduce performance and response accuracy.
- **File upload limitations**: You can upload up to 5 files with a total size of 10MB. Large files with excessive content may not be fully readable by the workflow, leading to less accurate results. Focus on including only the most important content in your uploaded files to stay within the token limits.
- **Ensure compliance**: Users must comply with the gen AI notice while using AskIBM, allowing challengers to explore scenarios that work within those guidelines. Completing the challenge with anonymized data and creating a strong business case can shape our product's future and inspire new directions.
- **Upload restrictions**: While you can't upload documents during a chat in the published workflow, you can upload them when building your workflow. These documents provide extra context, templates, and expand the AskIBM knowledge base. When people use your published workflow, they simply copy and paste the content they want summarized into AskIBM for quick and easy results.

### Basics of Prompt Engineering
Learning the basics of prompt engineering can help you effectively communicate with AI to get the results you want. Prompt engineering doesn't require any technical skills.

**What is Prompt Engineering?**
Prompt engineering is simply about asking the right questions or giving the right instructions to an AI to achieve your desired outcome. Think of it as giving clear directions to a very smart assistant.

**Basics of Prompting**

- **Be clear and specific**: When you communicate with AskIBM, clarity is key. Ensure your instructions are detailed and unambiguous. For example:
  - Not clear: "Help me with my notes."
  - Clear and detailed: "Organize customer feedback from our online survey, categorize comments by theme (product features, pricing, support), and generate a summary report highlighting key areas for improvement."
  
- **Provide context**: Give AskIBM comprehensive background information to enhance understanding and output quality. For example:
  - Without context: "Analyze this report."
  - With detailed context: "Analyze this market research report on consumer electronics trends, focusing on emerging technologies, key market players, and predicted growth areas. Provide an overview of data sources and research methodology used in the report." Upload the report for reference.

- **Use examples and templates**: Guide WatsonX by providing examples and templates. This can shape its responses more accurately. For example:
  - Without example: "Create a summary of this document."
  - With example and template: "Create a summary of this document in the format of an executive summary: Introduction, main points, conclusion. For instance, 'Meeting Notes: 1. Project timelines were discussed. 2. Tasks were assigned. 3. Key risks were identified.'" Upload a sample document for reference.

**Important Reminders**

- **Data Privacy and Security**: Make sure to follow the data privacy and security guidelines outlined in the Terms and Conditions Section 13.
- **IBM Business Conduct Guidelines**: Adhere to IBM Business Conduct Guidelines throughout the challenge.
