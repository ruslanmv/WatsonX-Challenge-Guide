# WatsonX Challenge: Track 3 - WCA@IBM

## Introduction

Welcome to the WatsonX Challenge! This competition invites technical IBMers to showcase their creativity and innovation in leveraging WCA@IBM, a state-of-the-art AI code assistant, to transform their software development practices. Participants will demonstrate how WCA@IBM accelerates and improves their SDLC processes and tasks.

## What is WCA@IBM?

WCA@IBM is an IBM-internal instance of WatsonX Code Assistant, powered by the IBM Granite-20b foundation LLM for code. This AI-powered tool assists with code understanding, code documentation, unit test writing, and code generation, enabling IBMers to achieve improved speed and efficiency in their software development.

## Challenge Overview

Participants will demonstrate how they leverage AI-powered features in WCA@IBM to redefine and accelerate their SDLC processes and tasks. The challenge is open to technical IBMers, and teams can consist of up to 10 people. To be eligible for prizes, participants must complete the AI Assistants Level 1 learning course by July 19.

## Environment and Prerequisites

Before starting the challenge, participants must ensure their environment meets the minimum version requirements listed below:

### OS

- **Windows**: 10, 11
- **MacOS**: v14/Sonoma

### IDE

- **Visual Studio Code**: min. v1.83.1, recommended 1.90
- **Eclipse**: min. 2023-09, recommended 2023-12

Supported languages include Java, JavaScript, Python, Golang, TypeScript, C, and C++.
### The Challenge

**Goal:** Demonstrate how WCA@IBM transforms your software development practices. Show how you leverage AI-powered features in WCA@IBM in the most creative and innovative way to redefine and accelerate your SDLC (Software Development Life-Cycle) processes and tasks.

You must complete tasks 1 and 2 below to submit for a chance to win this challenge. Note that task 3 is optional for advanced users only (Python developers).

Visit the 'resources' section below for instructions on how to set up WCA@IBM.

#### Task 1 – Use WCA@IBM to Understand Code

WCA@IBM will help you understand methods and files up to a certain size (typically 150 lines), allowing you to make changes in the tool more confidently.

**Example:**  
WCA@IBM can analyze and provide insights into the structure and functionality of a piece of code, identifying key components and their interactions.

**Your Turn:**  
Use WCA@IBM to analyze a section of your code, and document the insights provided by the tool.

#### Task 2 – Use WCA@IBM to Document Code

WCA@IBM will help you to document your methods and code files up to a certain size (typically 150 lines).

**Example:**  
The tool can generate comprehensive documentation for methods and classes, detailing their purpose, parameters, return values, and examples.

**Your Turn:**  
Use WCA@IBM to generate documentation for a section of your code, and review the output for accuracy and completeness.

#### Optional

**Task 3 (Advanced) – Use WCA@IBM to Develop Code**

Python development skills required for this task. WCA@IBM will help you create a Python class that represents a customer, including validation logic and documentation.

**Learn:**
