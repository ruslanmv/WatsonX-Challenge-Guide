**WatsonX Challenge: Track 5 - watsonx.ai and watsonx.data**
=====================================================


**Introduction**

Welcome to the WatsonX Challenge, where you'll learn to create a Retrieval Augmented Generative (RAG) workflow using the WatsonX platform, comprising WatsonX.ai and WatsonX.data. This challenge is designed for technical IBMers who want to improve IBMer productivity using generative AI technology.

**Challenge Overview**

Your task is to create a RAG-based generative AI workflow using WatsonX.ai and WatsonX.data. You'll be provided with a sample use case and a collection of business documents or can bring your own internal use cases and dataset. The goal is to demonstrate how the generative AI application will improve IBMer productivity.

**Requirements**

* Experienced data engineer on the team with SQL skills, database scaling and setup knowledge, and experience building, testing, and maintaining database pipelines.
* Use IBM's flagship Granite models for completing this track. No external models or tuning of existing models are allowed.
* Adhere to IBM Business Conduct Guidelines and data privacy and security guidelines outlined in Terms and Conditions Section 13.

**Optional Advanced Capabilities**

A small subset of experienced technical IBMers with advanced data engineering skills can request to use WatsonX.data's native Presto and Spark engine as part of their use case. This optional track has limited capacity, and interested participants must fill out a form after registration.

**The Challenge**
Goal:
Create a RAG workflow using WatsonX.ai and WatsonX.data to demonstrate generative AI applications improving team productivity. Use IBM granite-13b-chat-v2 foundation model and slate-30m-english-rtrvr embeddings model. External models or tuning are not permitted.

Scenarios:
Choose one scenario and proceed with the appropriate option:

Scenario 1 - Create RAG use case for internal product development teams
Scenario 2 - Create RAG use case for your own team
Options:

RAG using WatsonX.data (Milvus) (and optional Presto/Spark)

Ideal for teams with experienced data engineers.
Optional Presto/Spark scenario available only for teams who signed up between June 17 and July 3.
RAG using WatsonX.ai flows engine and WatsonX.data (Milvus)

Suitable for application developers aiming to build end-to-end RAG experiences.
Guidance:

Review detailed guidance to integrate WatsonX.ai with WatsonX.data for RAG.
Review detailed guidance to build AI apps for RAG using WatsonX.ai flows engine.
