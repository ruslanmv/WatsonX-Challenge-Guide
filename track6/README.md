## The Challenge

### What is Your Goal?

You will be responsible for building an AI assistant using WatsonX Orchestrate—IBM's platform designed for enterprises to launch AI assistants for various front and back office functions such as sales, IT, procurement, finance, customer care, etc.

### Tool Access

For the 2024 IBMer WatsonX Challenge, you will need to follow a unique set of steps to select your tenant and configure access.

### Select One from the Following Options to Complete During the Challenge:

#### Option 1 – Build an AI Assistant for HR Professionals

In this scenario, build an AI assistant that helps teams self-serve on HR-related matters, freeing up their time and reducing the burden on HR professionals. You'll be able to quickly infuse generative AI and automation within this HR assistant, accelerating time to value for the organization. This option is recommended for non-technical teams, allowing them to follow step-by-step guidance to build an assistant.

#### Option 2 – Design an AI Assistant That Helps Users Resolve a Set of Business Tasks for a Front or Back Office Function

Using WatsonX Orchestrate, participants in this scenario will design, build, and launch a domain-specific AI assistant that maximizes productivity. Participants need to identify a day-to-day business process that includes a set of complex tasks and design an AI assistant that fast-tracks users through those tasks. This option is recommended for technical teams looking to build a custom AI assistant.

**Note:** It is recommended that participants who choose Option 2 also complete Option 1.

## Submission

Whether you're competing to win with a solution that could be scaled across the company or participating to improve your productivity in a simple but meaningful way, every submission represents a way in which we are all using this transformative technology and collectively serves as an example for our clients and partners how generative AI is transforming business. Submit it all, no usage is too small!

### Submission Steps:

- **Complete Required Learning**: Each team member must complete the AI Assistants Level 1 learning course by July 19.
- **Develop During the Challenge**: Any solution submitted must have been developed during the challenge period, July 10–19.
- **Submit by Deadline**: Submission due date is Friday, July 19, 10:00 AM (ET).

### Track Deliverables

For each scenario, you need to submit:

1. **3-minute long video pitch (URL)**: Provide a 2-3 minute video that demonstrates the variety of topics the AI assistant can help with and how they drive enterprise productivity at scale. Articulate the efficiencies, savings, and revenue generated by the AI assistant. Judges will not watch more than 3 minutes of your video. Please provide the link to the video and ensure that it is accessible internally to all IBMers.
2. **Topics Covered (Number)**: Provide the number of topics (total number of actions) the AI assistant can cover. It's the sum of custom-built Actions, AI Guided Actions, and Skill-based Actions found in your Actions panel.
3. **Percentage of Time Saved (Number)**: Share how much time can be saved using the productivity assistant you built (expressed as a percentage). Enter a value between 1 and 100. 100% means that particular task can be fully replaced by using your productivity assistant.
4. **Explain Percentage of Time Saved (Free Text)**: Describe how you arrived at your "percentage of time saved" answer, with calculations clearly shown. Provide details on time and $ savings, such as a breakdown of the percentage of people per domain that would use the AI assistant, how frequently they would use it, number of tasks automated each time, time saved per task, and total revenue and cost saved through automation.

### Additional Deliverable

The last step of the challenge requires teams to provide feedback to the product team. Participants need to make sure their team lead completed Step 3 in the Tool Access Resources section above and set up the survey track skill for them. Once that is completed, they can go through the provided video to submit feedback.

## Conclusion

The WatsonX Challenge is an exciting opportunity to showcase your skills and creativity in designing innovative AI solutions.
