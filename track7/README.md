**WatsonX Challenge: Track 7 - InstructLab**
=====================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Welcome to the WatsonX Challenge, Track 7 - InstructLab! In this challenge, we aim to increase the number of IBMers trained on InstructLab's capabilities to drive innovation across our portfolio and make our Granite model better by contributing new knowledge and skills from IBMers.

**Objective**
------------

The objective of this challenge is to modify existing or add new knowledge and skills to improve the accuracy of answers provided by Granite. To achieve this, you will suggest a use case for embedding the Granite model into your software or hardware product/solution, demonstrate its limitations, and then use InstructLab to modify and/or generate data towards improving the Granite model for your use case.

**Technical Requirements**
-------------------------

To participate in this challenge, you must meet the following technical requirements:

* Be a developer with the ability to:
	+ Install and operate the iLab CLI
	+ Use GitHub, e.g., open pull requests (PRs) to a GitHub repository
* Be part of a product team who wants to customize IBM Granite models to their use case
* Be a practitioner of gen AI and LLMs with some experience
* Have an Apple M1/M2/M3 MacBook with approximately 32 GB RAM
* Have a C++ compiler and Python 3.9+ (<3.12 for PyTorch JIT) installed
* Have approximately 60GB disk space available

**Challenge Steps**
-------------------

To complete this challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Suggest a use case**: Identify a use case for embedding the Granite model into your software or hardware product/solution.
2. **Demonstrate limitations**: Show that the Granite model is not initially helpful for solving the use case, but can be solved with another potentially larger model.
3. **Use InstructLab**: Modify and/or generate data towards improving the Granite model for your use case using InstructLab.

**Learning Resources**
